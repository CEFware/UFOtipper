UFO Tipper

How It Works

1. UFOTipper authenticates your identity when you Sign In via Twitter. A unique UFO coin address is then created for you.
2. Your account becomes activated when you deposit sufficient UFO coins (2000 UFO).
3. Now you can send UFO coins over twitter by tweeting at anyone (they do not need an account to initially receive UFO coins). For example, “@friend, thanks bro, here’s 1,000 UFO #UFOTipper”. The UFO miner fees are automatically deducted from your account.
4. The UFOTipper Bot, @UFOTipper, constantly listens for every tweet containing #UFOtipper or @UFOtipper. The Bot will then parse the tweet, looking for the recipient and send amount. (See Below)
5. As soon as the funds are sent, both you and the recipient will receive a confirmation tweet.
6. An account is automatically created for the recipient if they do not already have one. The recipient will then need to authenticate via twitter within 21 days to receive the UFO coins, otherwise, the UFO coins are automatically refunded to the sender.
